      <h2>Subject: Confirmation of Completed IT112 Assignments</h2>

      <p>Hi Monte,</p>

      <p>I hope you’re doing well.</p>

      <p>
        I wanted to follow up to confirm my completion status for the IT112
        assignments. I’ve included a table below listing the assignments I’ve
        submitted, their current grading status, and any outstanding points.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >Notably, while the “Setting Up A Flask Environment - VS Code”
          assignment was not configured for submission on Canvas, I did complete
          the task as instructed and provided screenshots for your
          review.</strong
        >
        I’ve reflected that in the table as well.
      </p>
